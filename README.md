# Note Block Player
A client-side mod that allows you to use note blocks as a MIDI output.

Press P to open the menu.
From there, you can either select a file and click Play File, or press Play from Device to read from a MIDI device.
In order to play a note, you must be within range of a note block with that pitch.

This works by sending a left click action to note blocks at the correct time.

Currently, only a 1.15.2 version is available.
Requires Fabric API and LibGui.

This will probably get you banned if the server uses an anticheat - I'm not responsible for that.
